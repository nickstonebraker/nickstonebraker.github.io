  <h1>Hi there!</h1>
  <span>
    You've found our dog Teddy!  If you haven't noticed, he's a bit of an explorer.  If you're concerned about his well-being, please call one of his owners:

    As a last resort, there's an anchored steel cable tether in our front yard.  If it's more convenient, you can attach him to the tether send us a text message & we'll return shortly (or send someone) to let him in.  Thanks so much!
